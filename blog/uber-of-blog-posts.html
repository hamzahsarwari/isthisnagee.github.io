          &#8220;Think of us as the Uber of {{industry}}&#8221;.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does that even mean? Like it actually makes no sense to me. What qualities do you have that make you uber-like, and are those qualities even unique to uber? What? It seems lazy and unimaginative&#8212;you described all your hard work as the &#8220;Uber of&#8221; whatever your industry is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&#8217;s take some things about Uber that may or may not be true but somehow happen to be part of <em>my</em> impression of Uber. This is what I think of when you say you&#8217;re the &#8220;Uber of&#8221; whatever industry you&#8217;re in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You have a huge problem with sexual harrasments.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are automating some part of {{industry}} and are partnered with a bunch of universities funding research
          </li>
          <li>
            You have solid infrastructure and are known for it.
          </li>

          <li>
            I&#8217;d rather pay a little bit more and take a cab in downtown Toronto, it&#8217;s faster.
          </li>
          <li>
            People have compared you to ISIS (this is an idiotic item to put and I don&#8217;t like adding it but it did become a meme in Toronto)
          </li>
          <li>
            I like your main competitor a little bit more.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are operating at a loss
          </li>
          <li>
            You are promising huge returns <em>one day</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            You treat part of your customer base like garbage
          </li>
          <li>
            You can operate at huge scale and quickly react to market demands
          </li>
          <li>
            You have a bunch of funding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your founder is an idiot.
          </li>
          <li>
            You constantly have issues with governments.
          </li>
          <li>
            People burn out quick.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I asked a friend what they think it means to be &#8220;Uber of {{indsutry}}&#8221;. They said &#8220;means a software solution for a physical demand that doesn&#8217;t currently have a software solution.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe it&#8217;s &#8220;a software solution that brings the physical product to you&#8221;? Probably not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please for stop using &#8220;Uber of {{industry}}&#8221;. It&#8217;s lazy, it&#8217;s generic, it comes with baggage, and it doesn&#8217;t mean anything unless you explicitly define what it is you mean (and if you&#8217;ve done that, might as well remove your comparison to Uber).
        </p>

          I&#8217;ve done things before where I&#8217;ve said &#8220;It&#8217;s like {{company}} of {{industry}}&#8221;, and I&#8217;m trying my best not to do that anymore. Maybe sometimes it&#8217;s the easiest way to make a connection?! Like I have a vague understanding of what people mean when they say they&#8217;re the Uber of something&#8212;that they&#8217;re revolutionizing their industry, but everybody thinks they&#8217;re doing that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#8217;d love to hear what your ideas on what it means to be &#8220;Uber of {{industry}}&#8221;.
